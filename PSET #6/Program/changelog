	Shine:
	- Added implementation of sem_inc
		- Initially, I used a naive implementation (no spinlock). This crashed frequently.
		- The current implementation uses a spinlock. This greatly reduced the frequency of crashes; however, crashes and hangs still happen (albeit infrequently). Is the problem elsewhere?
	- Added Semaphore Test program under semTest2.c
	- Added tempMask initialization to sem_init
	- Added signal handler for SIGUSR1 in sem_init
	- Added missing #includes to sem.c:
		- stdio.h
		- stdlib.h
		- unistd.h
		- sys/types.h
	- Fixed declarations in sem.h (void sem_try => int sem_try)
	- Fixed sigprocmask() sycall in sem_wait
	- Changed incorrect types in sem.c ( s->lp => &(s->lp) )
	- Changed all instances of "waitingList" to "waitList" in both sem.c and sem.h (previously, both "waitList" and "waitingList" were used, leading to errors)
	- Changed "i<curEnd" to "i< s->curEnd" in sem_inc

	- Added debug instrumentation

12-7-2020 Morning:
	- Added fifo.h
	- Added fifo.c
		- fifo has not been tested yet. Expect bugs.
	- Added testFifo.c
		- testFifo.c is currently empty - only used to test for compiler errors.
	- Updated makefile
